            Rotterdam, a vibrant port city in the Netherlands, is renowned for
            its modern architecture, dynamic cultural scene, and rich maritime
            heritage. As Europe's largest port, it serves as a global hub for
            trade and innovation, while its skyline—featuring iconic structures
            like the Cube Houses and the Erasmus Bridge—showcases its bold,
            forward-thinking spirit. The city is a melting pot of cultures,
            offering diverse culinary experiences, world-class museums such as
            the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, and lively festivals. Rotterdam's
            resilience is evident in its post-World War II reconstruction,
            transforming it into a symbol of creativity and urban renewal.
            Whether strolling along the bustling Markthal, exploring the
            historic Delfshaven district, or enjoying the scenic Maas River,
            Rotterdam seamlessly blends tradition with modernity, making it a
            must-visit destination.

            Rotterdam has always been one of the main centres of the shipping
            industry in the Netherlands. From the Rotterdam Chamber of the VOC,
            the world's first multinational, established in 1602, to the
            merchant shipping leader Royal Nedlloyd established in 1970, with
            its corporate headquarters located in the landmark building the
            'Willemswerf' in 1988. In 1997, Nedlloyd merged with the British
            shipping industry leader P&O forming the third largest merchant
            shipping company in the world. The Anglo-Dutch P&O Nedlloyd was
            bought by the Danish giant corporation 'AP Moller Maersk' in 2005
            and its Dutch operations are still headquartered in the
            'Willemswerf'. Nowadays, well-known companies with headquarters in
            Rotterdam are consumer goods company Unilever (since 2020 London),
            asset management firm Robeco, energy company Eneco, dredging company
            Van Oord, oil company Royal Dutch Shell (since 2021 London),
            terminal operator Vopak, commodity trading company Vitol and
            architecture firms MVRDV and Office for Metropolitan Architecture.
